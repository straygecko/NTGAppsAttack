A big thanks to everyone on XDA who help us all root our devices and get
them to do the things the manufacturers should have let us do in the 
first place.

Most of this work is based on the work of others who got gapps working on the
Nook Color and earlier firmware of the NST & NSTG.

First off, thanks to jeff_kz and his NookManager that made it so easy to root my NST.

I can't remember all the threads I read while getting this project put together
but here are the key ones that unlocked the mysteries of gapps for me - many from the
Nook Color where the orignal work was done and later applied to the NST:

And special thanks to CyanogenMod and their archive of old gapps files. http://wiki.rootzwiki.com/Google_Apps

My additions to this prior work are:
- Patch to server.jar to start Backup Manager which gets the setup wizard working
  and eliminates the YouTube-Gmail dance
- adding in MarketUpdater.apk and finding version of MarketUpdater.apk and
  vending.apk that are signed by same certificate so that Market updates itself
- Using awk to patch framework.jar so that the patch won't need to be manually
  redone for new firmware versions when line numbers and labels change in
  the smali
- sed in the install to remove shared user certs from packages.xml  I can't remember what
  wasn't installing right that caused me to add that and looking at a packages.xml after
  an install of NTgappsAttack the new cert(s) aren't added back so it may have been a particular
  set of gapps .apk's I was testing at one time and it may not be needed any more.  But it won't
  hurt either.
- The build system that pulls everything together and creates the distribution zip file.
- The custom menu and script for NookManager to do the install
